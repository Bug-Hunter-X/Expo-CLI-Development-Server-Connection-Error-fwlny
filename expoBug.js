This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo start` command and is related to how the development server handles the connection to your device or emulator.  The exact cause isn't always clear, but often involves networking issues, incorrect configurations, or conflicts with other running processes. It often manifests as a blank screen or a failure to connect to the development server.
