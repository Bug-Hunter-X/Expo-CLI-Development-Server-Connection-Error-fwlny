The solution focuses on addressing common causes of Expo CLI connection issues. It doesn't fix a specific code bug but rather guides troubleshooting steps.

1. **Check Network Connectivity:** Ensure your device or emulator has a stable network connection and can access the internet.  Verify that your firewall or proxy isn't blocking the necessary ports.
2. **Restart Development Server and Devices:** Stop the Expo development server (`Ctrl+C`), restart your device/emulator, and then restart the server using `expo start`.
3. **Check for Conflicting Processes:**  Ensure no other development servers or applications are using the same ports.  Check your system's process list to identify and stop conflicting processes.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, cached files or build artifacts can cause problems. Try cleaning the project (`expo prebuild --clean`) and rebuilding it.
5. **Check Device/Emulator Settings:** If using an Android emulator, verify its network configuration and ensure it has a proper IP address and connectivity. On physical devices, ensure that developer options are enabled and debugging is allowed. 
6. **Update Expo CLI:** Make sure you have the latest version of the Expo CLI by running `npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`.
7. **Check your Project's `package.json`**: Verify that all dependencies are correctly installed. Run `npm install` or `yarn` before starting again.
8. **Expo Doctor:** Use `expo doctor` to check for problems in your development environment. This command can often pinpoint configuration issues or dependencies problems.
